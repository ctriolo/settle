(We suggest playing our game in full screen, or at least by making the browser window as big as possible. Also, while the game should work on most browsers, we tested it mostly on Google Chrome and advise using that.) Upon arriving you will see our splash page, as seen below. Click Facebook Connect to begin.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><img height="385" src="images/image03.png" width="618"></p><p class="c2"><span>Facebook will ask you to login and allow access to our Settle app. After doing so, you will arrive at our Dashboard page, which is where you will join or create a game. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><img height="386" src="images/image06.png" width="619"></p><p class="c2"><span>The dashboard page shows all games that are about to start.

Depending on your adobe flash permissions, you may need to follow some special directions or click allow to let the site have access to your camera. (Also, the video box may expand out of the player box; this is intentional and is designed to make the video box fit the dialog it contains.) As players join, you will see them below on the right. When you are all ready to begin, click the Start button.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><img height="395" src="images/image02.png" width="624"></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>At this point, the game Settlers of Catan begins.

The game starts with the initial settlements phase. Each player places two settlements and two roads. Options that can be clicked are marked and made clickable. Once the initial settlement picking ends, the turns begin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><img height="394" src="images/image08.png" width="622"></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On your turn, you begin by rolling the dice. You can opt to play a knight card before this, if you have one. Resources are distributed according to the dice roll, or the robber piece is moved. Then, you can build (buy) something, play a development card, offer a trade, or end your turn. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><img height="392" src="images/image07.png" width="619"></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On other people&rsquo;s turns, you can receive resources according to dice rolls, and you can accept trades.
